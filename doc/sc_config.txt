---------------------------------------

SC: Status Change name/constants or ID.
    See src/map/script_constants.h for SC_

---------------------------------------

SI: Status Icon or client effect that will be displayed client-side.
    See src/map/script_constants.h for SI_

---------------------------------------

SCS: Specified states given when the SC is active. Use "|" as delimiter for multiple values.
     SCS_NONE               = (Default) Means nothing.
     SCS_NOMOVE             = Cannot move.
     SCS_NOMOVECOND         = Condition check for SCS_NOMOVE.
     SCS_NOPICKITEM         = Cannot pick item.
     SCS_NOPICKITEMCOND     = Condition check for SCS_NOPICKITEM.
     SCS_NODROPITEM         = Cannot drop item.
     SCS_NODROPITEMCOND     = Condition check for SCS_NODROPITEM.
     SCS_NOCAST             = Cannot cast a skill.
     SCS_NOCASTCOND         = Condition check for SCS_NOCAST.
     SCS_NOCHAT             = Cannot chat and open chat room.
     SCS_NOCHATCOND         = Condition check for SCS_NOCHATCOND.
     SCS_NOEQUIPITEM        = Cannot put on equipment.
     SCS_NOEQUIPITEMCOND    = Condition check for SCS_NOEQUIPITEM.
     SCS_NOUNEQUIPITEM      = Cannot put off equipment.
     SCS_NOUNEQUIPITEMCOND  = Condition check for SCS_NOUNEQUIPITEM.
     SCS_NOCONSUMEITEM      = Cannot consume item.
     SCS_NOCONSUMEITEMCOND  = Condition check for SCS_NOCONSUMEITEM.
     SCS_NOATTACK           = Cannot attack.
     SCS_NOATTACKCOND       = Condition check for SCS_NOATTACK.

	 Example, if we want to make the player unable to move and unable to cast skills when Berserk/Frenzy is active, the SCS value is:
	 SCS_NOMOVE|SCS_NOCAST

	 SCS that have a suffix of "COND" means the SCS has hardcoded conditions in status.c::status_calc_state

DisabledOn: Status Change will always be removed or fail to be inflicted on the specified map(s). Use "|" as delimiter for multiple values.
      1    - restricted in normal maps
      2    - restricted in PVP
      4    - restricted in GVG
      8    - restricted in Battlegrounds
      Restricted zones - configured by 'restricted <number>' mapflag
      32   - restricted in zone 1
      64   - restricted in zone 2
      128  - restricted in zone 3

      The different zones are bitmask values and can be applied using the "|" delimeter or by combining the values.

      Example:
         DisabledOn: "4" // Status will be removed when the player enters GvG and WoE Castle maps; Also cannot be inflicted on those maps. (Single zone)
	     DisabledOn: "1|4" // Status will be removed when the player enters Normal, GvG, WoE Castle maps; Also cannot be inflicted on those maps. (Multiple zones using "|")
	     DisabledOn: "5" // Status will be removed when the player enters Normal, GvG, WoE Castle maps; Also cannot be inflicted on those maps. (Multiple zones combined values)

Notes:

By default, statuses are 'Buff' type, which are removable by 'status_change_clear_buffs' function that is used by
Tarot (CG_TAROTCARD), Refresh (RK_REFESH), Luxanima (RK_LUXANIMA), Wand of Hermode (CG_HERMODE), Gospel
(PA_GOSPEL), and Inspiration (LG_INSPIRATION).

SCF_NO_CLEARBUFF prevents some permanent and non-permanent statuses that cannot be removed by the skills listed above
(doesn't matter if the status is a buff or debuff or the skill that attempts to remove it).

Tarot and Wand of Hermode only remove buffs and not debuffs (except statuses with SCF_DEBUFF).
While Gospel and Inspiration remove buffs and debuffs.

Refresh and Luxanima only remove statuses that have the flag SCF_REM_ON_REFRESH or SCF_REM_ON_LUXANIMA. Works
just like Dispell (SA_DISPELL), Clearance (AB_CLEARANCE), and Banishing Buster (RL_BANISHING_BUSTER) that has
effect to remove buffs or debuffs.
